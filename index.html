            The API I selected was Breaking Bad Quotes. It is an api that retrieves random quotes with their authors
            (speakers) from the TV show Breaking Bad.
            <p /><a href="https://breakingbadquotes.xyz/">Site Link</a>
            <p />
            For the first option, I used an API request with GET. This is the pattern that we went over in class, and it
            consists of a request to the server, then verification of the status and that the request has been
            fulfilled. Then, I accessed the json file, then parsed and displayed it. For the second option, I fetched
            the data from the site, skipping all of the trivial steps of the first method, and then I accessed the text
            of the json, parsed, and displayed it. This method was much easier than the first one because I was able to
            skip all of the steps associated with the request. I prefer the fetch option.
            <p />
            One application of this API could be that if someone were building a breaking bad blog and they wanted to
            display a quote on the home page of their blog. This api would allow the quote to be randomized and change
            every time the site is reloaded. Another application of this API could be if a person is a huge fan of the
            show and they wanted to add a quote to their homescreen on their computer. This could be a fun way to have
            different random quotes pop up. Not super useful, but if I were having a bad day and a funny quote popped up
            from my favorite show, my mood would be improved.
            </p>
            The most challenging thing about this assignment was actually getting the data to display in the correct
            spot. When I did document.write instead of changing the innerHTML of my divs, I couldn't style anything and
            headings were wiped. It was extremely satisfying to see the quotes displayed in their correct divs on the
            page, while everything but the displayed quotes stayed the same. It was a fun assignment!

                    if (ajaxRequest.status == 200) {
